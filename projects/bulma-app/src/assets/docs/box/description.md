# Box

#### A white box to contain other elements.

The `box` element is simply a container with a shadow, a border, a radius, and some padding.

To use a box component in your application, you need to import the `BulmaBoxModule` by adding the following lines to your `app.module.ts` file.

```javascript
import { BulmaBoxModule } from 'ngx-bulma';

@NgModule({
  imports: [BulmaBoxModule]
});
```

An example box is shown below.
