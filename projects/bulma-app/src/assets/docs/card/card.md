# Card Component

A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If youâ€™re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.

To display a card component in your app and verify that everything works.
You need to import the `BulmaCardModule` that you want to display by adding the following lines to your `app.module.ts` file.

```javascript
import { BulmaCardModule} from 'ngx-bulma'
 @NgModule({
   imports: [BulmaCardModule]
 });
```

To use the bulmacard component in your Angular application.
Add below components sequentially.
