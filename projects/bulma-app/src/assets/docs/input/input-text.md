# Input
#### The ```<input>``` tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data.

   ##### The following type attributes are supported:
   ``` type="text" ```
   ``` type="password" ```
   ``` type="email" ```
   ``` type="tel" ```

To display a  Input component in your app and verify that everything works.
You need to import the BulmaInputModule that you want to display by adding the following lines to your app.module.ts file.

 ```
import { BulmaInputModule} from 'ngx-bulma'
  @NgModule({
    imports: [BulmaInputModule]
  });
 ```
