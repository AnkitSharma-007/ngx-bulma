# Hero

#### An imposing hero banner to showcase something

The hero component allows you to add a **full width banner** to your webpage, which can optionally cover the full height of the page as well.

The basic requirement of this component are:

- `hero` as the main container
  - `hero-body` as a direct child, in which you can put all your content
